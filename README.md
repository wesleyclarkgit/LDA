Using LDA to Mine Nokia Customer Reviews


Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) is a powerful text analysis tool that can be used for categorization, segmentation and even topic modeling.  This is a form of unsupervised learning which aims to discover 'latent' topics within documents.  Documents are matched to topics by compaing word distributions in a document to that of avialable k-topics.  This analysis discoverd topics such as fingerprint sensor, camera and phone comparison.  Utilizing this technique allows Nokia to incorporate customer feedback directly into the resource allocation loop via reasearch and development funding for future phones.
